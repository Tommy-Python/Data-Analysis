I suspect that married people may be both responsible for repaying the loan or at least make an effort. This allows a spouse to support the partner financially. In the case of divorced people, the financial situation also seems to have been clarified in good time, and in some cases they are even regulated by law. In the case of widows/widowers, external help may be possible through a widow’s pension, which influences credit agreements. Unmarried people usually do not have a partner to support them, which is why the risk of failure is greatly increased. Even in partnerships, financial relationships seem to be unclear, which is why it can lead to failures due to the lack of structure and law."

Nevertheless, the differences between the purposes are very small. Purpose selection does not appear to be an appropriate criterion for determining creditworthiness."

The heavy head of the “income_level” suggests a segmentation of customers, since income does not fit into a normal distribution (Gaussian curve). The fluctuations in all tasks are very small and could be randomly."
