# Data Analysis Repository

## This is my personal repository for show my data-related skills and experience.


# Project: Data-preprocessing


Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.
Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

Used libaries:
- Numpy
- Pandas

# Project: AB-Test

You've received an analytical task from an international online store. Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

Used libaries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Functools
- Math
- Warnings
- Seaborn
- Datetime

# Project: Business Analytics

You've done beautifully in the Practicum course, and you've been offered an internship in the analytical department at Yandex.Afisha. Your first task is to help optimize marketing expenses.

# Project: Machine Learning
The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do you know if a customer is no longer with you? You can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts. However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.
Churn indicators vary from field to field. If a user buys from an online store rarely but regularly, you can't say they're a runaway. But if for two weeks they haven't opened a channel that's updated daily, that's a reason to worry: your follower might have gotten bored and left you.
For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Of course, it's possible they're in Cancun and will resume their visits when they return, but's that's not a typical case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they're unlikely to come back.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Your task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

# Project: SDA
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.
You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

# Project: SQL

The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers. You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

- SQAlchemy
- Pandas
